* GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

* WHEN I search for a city, THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city, THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

* WHEN I view the UV index, THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

* WWHEN I view future weather conditions for that city, THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
